# Motivation
- Lima is a rewrite of React, but only the basic parts
- I wrote it as an attempt to understand React fundamentals better
- ...and named it after my cat

# Files
- example application using Lima in /example
- checkout /example/src to see Lima in action
- the React rewrite lives in /src

# Implementation
- Lima written and published to npm in es6
- to run example app, run `cd example; npm install; npm start`
- to install Lima in your project, run `npm install lima-react --save` (although it's recommended you use the real React :p)

- see example app for build requirements (webpack / babel / jsx transpile, etc)
